 * This allows to represent differences of images, and signed differential operators

 * 
 * There is a polymorphic representation of signed images and unsigned images.
 * Linear operations (such as values scale, set constant value for voxels, subtraction/addition),
 * absolute values, positive and negative parts, etc. are also provided.
 * 
 * The interfaces also provide an operation to map an unsigned image onto a signed image,
 * scaling the values if necessary, even handling the case when the bit depths are different
 * for the signed and unsigned images (in which case some information may be lost).
